Event types:
Breakpoint - time - Stops dcpu when time is reached and call dcpu.onbreak()
HWEvent - time, device - Tells the device to handle an event

No hardware ticks, hardware keeps track of time by use of events.

typedef struct event {
    enum {breakpoint, device, } type;
    void *data;
    int time;
    struct event *nextevent;
} event;
